        <h2>What happens in the fifth month of pregnancy?</h2>

        <div class="container">
            <p>When you’re 5 months pregnant, your fetus develops soft body hair and a greasy coating that helps protect the skin. </p>
            <div class="first-container">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>What happens during weeks 17 - 18?</h3>
                    <p>The fetus has a CRL of 5.5–6 inches (14–15 cm).</p>
                    <h3>What happens during week 19 - 20?</h3>
                    <p>The fetus has a CRL of about 6.5 inches (16 cm). Lanugo — a fine downy hair — covers the body.  The skin is also covered with vernix caseosa, a greasy material that protects the skin. A uterus forms in a biologically female fetus.</p>

                    <h3>What are the symptoms of pregnancy in the fifth month? </h3>
                    <p>People usually feel fetal movements for the first time during the fifth month. It may feel like flutters or butterflies in your stomach. This is sometimes called quickening.</p>
                    <p>The pregnancy symptoms of the fourth month continue this month. Heartburn, constipation, breast changes, dizziness, shortness of breath, nose bleeds, and gum bleeding are common. Your breasts may be as much as 2 cup sizes bigger by now.</p>

                    <h3>What happens during week 3 - 4?</h3>
                    <p>The fertilized egg moves down your fallopian tube and divides into more and more cells. It reaches your uterus about 3–4 days after fertilization. The dividing cells then form a ball that floats around in the uterus for about 2–3 days. </p>
                    <p>Pregnancy begins when the ball of cells attaches to the lining of your uterus. This is called implantation. It usually starts about 6 days after fertilization and takes about 3–4 days to be complete.</p>
                    <p>Pregnancy doesn’t always happen, even if an egg is fertilized by a sperm. Up to half of all fertilized eggs pass out of your body when you get your period, before implantation is complete.</p>

                    <h3>What are the signs of pregnancy?</h3>
                    <p>For a lot of people, the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Most pregnancy tests will be positive by the time you’ve missed your period. Other early pregnancy symptoms include feeling tired, feeling bloated, peeing more than usual, mood swings, nausea, and tender or swollen breasts. Not everyone has all of these symptoms, but it’s common to have at least 1 of them.</p>
