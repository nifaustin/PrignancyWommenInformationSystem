                    <h3>What are the symptoms of pregnancy in the fourth month?</h3>
                    <p>Some of the early signs and symptoms of pregnancy go away when you’re 4 months pregnant. Nausea usually lessens. But other digestive problems — like heartburn and constipation — may be troublesome. Breast changes — growth, soreness, and darkening of the areola — usually continue. It’s common to have shortness of breath or to breathe faster. Increased blood flow may lead to unpleasant pregnancy symptoms, such as bleeding gums, nosebleeds, or nasal stuffiness. You also may feel dizzy or faint because of changes in your blood and blood vessels.</p>
